ABSTRACT={Humans sometimes attempt to infer an artificial agent's mental state based on mere observations of its behavior. From the agent's perspective, it is important to choose actions with awareness of how its behavior will be considered by humans. Previous studies have proposed computational methods to generate such publicly self-aware motion to allow an agent to convey a certain intention by motions that can lead a human observer to infer what the agent is aiming to do. However, little consideration has been given to the effect of information asymmetry between the agent and a human, or to the gaps in their beliefs due to different observations from their respective perspectives. This paper claims that information asymmetry is a key factor for conveying intentions with motions. To validate the claim, we developed a novel method to generate intention-conveying motions while considering information asymmetry. Our method utilizes a Bayesian public self-awareness model that effectively simulates the inference of an agent's mental states as attributed to the agent by an observer in a partially observable domain. We conducted two experiments to investigate the effects of information asymmetry when conveying intentions with motions by comparing the motions from our method with those generated without considering information asymmetry in a manner similar to previous work. The results demonstrate that by taking information asymmetry into account, an agent can effectively convey its intention to human observers.}

abstract = {To create dialogue systems that provide information a user needs to know at an opportune moment, it is important to infer the user’s mental states such as his/her beliefs and desires. There are two types of study on inferring beliefs and desires: one type infers them from actions and the other infers them from the content of utterances. However, a method to infer beliefs and desires from both kinds of inference in an integrated way has not yet been established. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Inference of Mind Simultaneous Contextualization and Interpreting (MIoM SCAIN), a system for sequentially inferring users’ beliefs and desires on the basis of their walking behaviors and the content of their utterances. In our evaluation, we compared inferences of MIoM SCAIN with those of baselines that use either walking behaviors or the content of utterances. MIoM SCAIN’s predictions showed more correlation with subjective judgements compared with the baselines, indicating that the inference of beliefs and desires from both walking behaviors and utterance content is possible.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a system that sequentially generates advertisements within the context of a dialogue. Advertisements tailored to the user have long been displayed on the digital signage in stores, on web pages, and on smartphone applications. Advertisements will work more effectively if they are aware of the context of the dialogue between the users. Creating an advertising sentence as a query and searching the web by using that query is one way to present a variety of advertisements, but there is currently no method to create an appropriate search query for the search in accordance with the dialogue context. Therefore, we developed a method called the Conversational Context-sensitive Advertisement generator (CoCoA). The novelty of CoCoA is that advertisers simply need to prepare a few abstract phrases, called Core-Queries, and then CoCoA dynamically transforms the Core-Queries into complete search queries in accordance with the dialogue context. Here, “transforms” means to add words related to the context in the dialogue to the prepared Core-Queries. The transformation is enabled by a masked word prediction technique that predicts a word that is hidden in a sentence. Our attempt is the first to apply masked word prediction to a web information retrieval framework that takes into account the dialogue context. We asked users to evaluate the search query presented by CoCoA against the dialogue text of multiple domains prepared in advance and found that CoCoA could present more contextual and effective advertisements than Google Suggest or a method without the query transformation. In addition, we found that CoCoA generated high-quality advertisements that advertisers had not expected when they created the Core-Queries.},
